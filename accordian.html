                What is the purpose of the "this" keyword in JavaScript?

            <div class="answer">
                <p>The "this" keyword refers to the current execution context. In a method, "this" represents the object
                    that the method is called on. In a function, "this" refers to the global object (window in a
                    browser) unless the function is part of an object.</p>

                What is JavaScript and what role does it play in web development?

            <div class="answer">
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for enhancing
                    interactivity in web browsers. It allows developers to create dynamic content, handle events, and
                    manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage.</p>

                What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does it work?
                <i class="fas fa-plus icon"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations. It
                    continuously checks the message queue for events or functions to execute, making it possible to
                    manage tasks like AJAX requests without blocking the main thread.</p>

                How does JavaScript handle hoisting?
                <i class="fas fa-plus icon"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>JavaScript hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of
                    their containing scope during the compilation phase. Variables declared with "var" are hoisted and
                    initialized with "undefined," while functions are hoisted with their full definition.</p>
